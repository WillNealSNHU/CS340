How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I always think of SCRUM/Agile practices, small sprints and constantly updating. Good documentation (what I did, how and why), tons of testing (manual and otherwise) as well as peer review (sending in for grading). The nice thing about what this class had to offer was most things were reusable. I think the CRUD work could be reused and adapted for other projects as well.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I think the best answer to this is not give up. I understand the generic "I would be creative", "I would use deductive reasoning", "I would view things analytically". I get it I really do. I have been writing code professionally for four years now for fortune 500 companies (PNC Bank and 3M). I can say this the thing that has never failed me when approaching a problem is tenacity. I think too many times we give up. We say I am just not going to do it, or I can't do it or I won't do it. I think given enough time and resources I can and will figure out the answer. Now it might take me longer than I want, and I might lose some sleep but I eventually I will solve the problem.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I mean computer scientists do a lot of things, thatâ€™s a really broad stroke question. I think in terms of what we did here I would say we did some database management and data analysis. I think we helped Grazioso make informed decisions with sound and factually based data. I think we provided that data in a visually appealing and understanding way.
